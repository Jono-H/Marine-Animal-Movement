# Marine-Animal-Movement
R code for the analysis of animal tracking data. Primarily GPS and PTT tags

Scripts in this repository are used for the analysis of marine animal tracking data. Typically, large predators such as birds and mammals.
However, many of the scripts and instructions will be relevant to anyone dealing with animal tracking data.

Remember, if you are new to using R, or any other coding language/platform/package/software (whichever term people tend to mix up), then I 
strongly suggest you go and learn what R is and how it works first! It will save you much more time than you realise by doing this first.

Find a good introductory course, e.g: COURSERA

Find a good book, e.g: R for Data Science (Wickham & Grolemund, 2017)

Review several blogs to check which introductory courses and books are trending.

Practice with friends and have fun!
